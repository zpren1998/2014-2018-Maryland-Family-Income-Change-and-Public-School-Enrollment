# 2015-2019-Maryland-Family-Income-Change-and-Public-School-Enrollment
## Introduction
Income is the basis of people's livelihood and influences different aspects in citizens’ life. Education, which brings knowledge and awareness of the world, and develops our perspective of looking at life, is one of the most important aspects in citizen happiness. Therefore, looking at how school enrollment changes with family income in different years allows us to have better understanding to the influence of family income in citizens’ life. In this project, family income change and family income range change in Maryland and 10 counties with most population are studied. In order to investigate the influence of family income in Maryland basic education, change of public-school enrollment, and correlation between enrollment data of four different grade ranges i.e. pre-kindergarten to kindergarten (PreK-K), kindergarten to grade 5 (K-5), grade 6 to grade 8 (6-8), and grade 9 to grade 12 (9-12) and family income are calculated.  
The results showed that from 2014 to 2018, median and mean family income in Maryland and 10 counties in Maryland with the most population increased. Income difference among counties in Maryland fluctuates in these five years, ranges from 68,000 to 81,000. Public school enrollment of four grade levels only slightly changes in five years, and have poor correlation to family income. 
## Questions & Aims
Family income influences many aspects of citizens’ life, one of which is education. Education for juveniles provides them with basic survival skills in society and knowledge of literature, mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Family can influence the education of the children, and education also influence the children’s future families. Therefore, the closed loop of education-family-income is vital for the country and is important for every of us to be aware of.  
The major question that this project tried to solve is how family income potentially relate to public school enrollment. This project served as a preliminary phase of looking into the impact of family income in citizens’ life. Although family income is not the only factor that change school enrollment, observation result of this project can show how enrollment changes as family income, and be used in building the model of school enrollment. Two aims of this project are:  
1. Investigate 2014-2018 family income and distribution change in Maryland.
2. Study correlation between family income and public-school enrollment.
## Data decision
### _Aim 1: Investigate 2014-2018 family income and distribution change in Maryland_
To study family income change in Maryland from 2014 to 2018, median and mean family income data from 2014 to 2018 in Maryland was acquired from [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). In this data, distribution in different income ranges were also included, therefore these data were also visualized to better analyze the income structure in Maryland.  
Family income in 10 counties in Maryland with highest population were also visualized. To pick out these 10 counties, Maryland population estimation from 2014 to 2018 were acquired from [Maryland State Open Data](https://opendata.maryland.gov/). Median income data of Maryland counties were acquired from the same data source. 
### _Aim 2: Study correlation between family income and public-school enrollment_
Before studying the correlation, public school enrollment change of different grade levels were investigated using data obtained from [Maryland State Open Data](https://opendata.maryland.gov/). After analyzing the trend of public-school enrollment, the correlation coefficient of enrollment count and family income is calculated.

The graph above shows the distribution of 2014-2018 overall family income distribution in Maryland. As the bar-chart shows, fraction of high-income ranges i.e. above $100,000 increased, whereas those of low-income range i.e. below $100,000 decreased from 2014-2018, showing the increasing of mean family income in Maryland. This is in agreement with the mean and median family income data, as the line chart above shows. From 2014 to 2018, both mean and median family income are increasing. Median family income increased from $90,000 to $100,000, and average family income increased from $110,000 to $130,000.

To have a deeper investigation of family income change in Maryland, 10 counties in Maryland with highest population were studied, and the list of counties are shown in the table above. The line-chart above illustrates change of median family income of the 10 counties from 2014 to 2018, and each line stands for a county. As the line-chart shows, although there are decrease in some counties in certain time period, the general trend of family income change was increasing, which is accordant with Maryland overall family income. Median family income difference among counties were calculated as the Highest county family median income - Lowest county family median income, and the difference fluctuates in the 5-year time period, which ranges from $68,000 to $81,000, as the line-chart below shows.
